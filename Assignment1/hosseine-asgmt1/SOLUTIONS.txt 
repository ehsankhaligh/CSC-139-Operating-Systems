• What is the CPU type and model?
cat /proc/cpuinfo
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 0 @ 2.50GHz
vendor_id     : GenuineIntel

• What version of the Linux kernel is being used?
cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.6.32-696.3.2.el6.i686

• How long (in days, hours, and minutes) has it been since the system was last booted?
wk '{print int($1/86400)":"int(($1%86400)/3600)":"int(($1%3600)/60)}' /proc/uptime
454:19:10

• How much of the total CPU time has been spent executing in user mode? System mode? Idle?
cat /proc/stat

USER 1181520484
system 73120517
idle 14413006648

Man page description:

Common entries include:

cpu  3357 0 4313 1362393

The amount of time, measured in units of USER_HZ (1/100ths of a second on most architectures,
use sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to obtain the right value), that the system spent in
user mode, user mode with low priority (nice), system mode, and the idle task, respectively.
The last value should be USER_HZ times the second entry in the uptime pseudo-file.


• How much memory is configured into it?
cat /proc/meminfo
MemTotal:        4019168 kB

• How much memory is currently available on it?
cat /proc/meminfo
MemFree:          134960 kB

• How many disks read/write requests have been made?
cat /proc/diskstats

Reads completed: 51571078 Writes Completed: 58622246

man page description:
This file contains disk I/O statistics for each disk device.  See the kernel source file Documentation/iostats.txt for further information.

Field  1 -- # of reads completed
  This is the total number of reads completed successfully.
Field  5 -- # of writes completed
  This is the total number of writes completed successfully.

• How many context switches has the kernel performed?

/proc/[pid]/status

Man page description:

Provides much of the information in /proc/[pid]/stat and /proc/[pid]/statm in a format that’s easier for humans to parse.  Here’s an example:  $ cat /proc/$$/status

* voluntary_context_switches, nonvoluntary_context_switches: Number of voluntary and involuntary context switches (since Linux 2.6.23).

Answer:
voluntary_ctxt_switches:      759
nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches:   2

• How many processes have been created since the system was booted?

cat /proc/stat

man page descritpn:
The "processes" line gives the number  of processes and threads created, which
includes (but  is not limited  to) those  created by  calls to the  fork() and
clone() system calls.

processes 151467960
